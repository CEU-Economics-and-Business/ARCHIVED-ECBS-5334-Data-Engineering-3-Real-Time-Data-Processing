## Amazon Kinesis 

You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process large streams of data records in real time. 
You can create data-processing applications, known as Kinesis Data Streams applications. 
A typical Kinesis Data Streams application reads data from a data stream as data records. 
These applications can use the Kinesis Client Library, and they can run on Amazon EC2 instances. 
You can send the processed records to dashboards, use them to generate alerts, dynamically change pricing and advertising strategies, or send data to a variety of other AWS services.
